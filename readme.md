## Account Holder
The purpose of this program is to provide a single application where you can store
your usernames and passwords for your various accounts in one place. It was 
created using Python and PySimpleGUI. 

The program features very basic encryption of passwords in the database so
they are not easily accessed and in plain view. Moreover, users will be 
prompted to create an account on initial launch, and subsequent uses of the 
program will require password authetication. The encryption key for this program
is easily found within the program files so please keep this in mind when
deciding what to store in the program. If anyone would like to send a pull 
request and enhance the encryption of this program, I'd enjoy the opportunity
to review your pull request and learn from it!

If you're like me and have one too many accounts to remember, I hope you find
some use out of this program!
